Hi, I'm Palak Gupta

I’m a third-year Mathematics–Computer Science major at UC San Diego, passionate about uncovering insights through data and building intelligent, scalable systems. My interest lies at the intersection of data analysis, machine learning, and business intelligence, with a growing curiosity for AI and fintech solutions.

With a strong foundation in statistics and programming, I love exploring data to tell meaningful stories, solve real-world problems, and improve decision-making processes. Whether through academic projects or hands-on tools, I’m always up for learning new techniques and frameworks to grow as a data-driven problem solver.

Here’s a look at some of my hands-on projects in data science and software development:

🔤 WordlePlus

Languages & Tools: Python, HTML, CSSA twist on the classic Wordle game! Users guess a 5-letter word within 6 attempts. After 3 incorrect guesses, a hint can be requested via an API that reveals one correct letter in the right position.Features:

Points-based scoring system

Hint mechanics using API

Progress tracking

Front-end and back-end integration

✈️ Airline Industry Use Case: Predicting Airfares

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPyThis project predicts airfare prices based on flight data, including factors such as source, destination, stops, and flight duration.Steps Involved:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering

Building and evaluating regression modelsGoal: Understand pricing trends and key factors that influence airfare.

💰 Loan Default Risk Prediction

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

This project aims to predict whether a loan will default based on applicant data and credit history.Focus Areas:

Data wrangling and missing value treatment

EDA and feature importance

Classification modeling using logistic regression and decision treesOutcome: Built a predictive model to classify high-risk applicants and assist in financial decision-making.
