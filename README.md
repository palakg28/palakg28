Hi, I'm Palak Gupta

I’m a rising senior at UC San Diego majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. I am passionate about uncovering insights through data and building intelligent, scalable systems. My interest lies at the intersection of data analysis, machine learning, and business intelligence, with a growing curiosity for AI and fintech solutions.

With a strong foundation in statistics and programming, I love exploring data to tell meaningful stories, solve real-world problems, and improve decision-making processes. Whether through academic projects or hands-on tools, I’m always up for learning new techniques and frameworks to grow as a data-driven problem solver.
